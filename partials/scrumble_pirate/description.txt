We found an envelope with a weird content.
One is a piece of paper with a nonsense writing and an image:
- challenge.txt
- compass.png

The envelope presents only a description on the outside:
"This is the beginning of a new era, the era of the pirates!
Are you able to find the treasure with the compass and the encrypted message?"

Note: the final plaintext must have only "lowercase" letters

Rules: 
You cannot use online tools to solve the challenge automatically.
Provide a Python solution, where you explain every consolidation you made to achieve the solution.
